        <Dialogue>Hello, Officer! Thanks for coming! We have a very important delivery.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>The armoured bank truck will deliver a large amount of money to our destination.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>You will drive the truck, and an armoured SWAT vehicle will follow.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>We’ve received reports that an attack might occur. That’s why we have you and the SWAT team. Let’s go!</Dialogue>

    <Bankman>
        <Dialogue>Hello! I see you made it out alive. Now you know why we hire professionals like you, not like... my colleagues.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>... Definitely. At least the SWAT vehicle is bulletproof.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>The money truck is armoured too—only the windows aren't.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>Here’s the case.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>Perfect, thank you. I’ll put in a good word for you!</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>I hope the risk was worth it. Have a nice day!</Dialogue>
