    <DIALOGUE0>
        <DIALOGUE>~y~You:~s~ Hello sir, what happened here?</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Hi! I was attacked! The prisoner—he just snapped!</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ He assaulted me while I was watching the traffic. I flipped the bus accidentally, then he jumped out of the bus.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ He’s on foot now, ran off into the woods wearing his orange jumpsuit!</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~y~You:~s~ Do you have any idea where he might be headed?</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Last I saw, he was headed north, past that ridge over there.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ He might try to steal a car, or hide somewhere.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Be careful—he’s dangerous and desperate!</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Oh my god, he took my gun, too! I can't find it!</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~y~You:~s~ Alright. I’ll find him.</DIALOGUE>
    </DIALOGUE0>
    <DIALOGUE1>
        <DIALOGUE>~y~You:~s~ Sir, are you alright? What’s going on here?</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ That inmate lost it! He attacked me out of nowhere!</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ I was checking directions on my tablet, and he took the chance to overpower me. The bus rolled when I tried to stop him.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ He bolted as soon as we crashed—ran straight into the woods in full orange.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~y~You:~s~ Which way did he go?</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Northbound, over that hill. He was fast, too!</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ If he finds a car or a hiding spot, we might lose him.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Watch out, officer—he's not thinking straight.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Damn it, I just realized… he took my service weapon!</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~y~You:~s~ Got it. I’m going after him now.</DIALOGUE>
    </DIALOGUE1>
    <DIALOGUE2>
        <DIALOGUE>~y~You:~s~ What happened? Are you injured?</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ No serious injuries, but it was close. The inmate flipped—he ambushed me!</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ I lost control of the transport vehicle during the struggle. He forced the door open and made a run for it.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Last I saw him, he was heading for the tree line. Still in the jumpsuit.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~y~You:~s~ Any clue where he might be going?</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Could be trying to reach the main road or find a hiding place nearby.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ He’s unpredictable, and probably armed now.</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~o~Prison Guard:~s~ Damn… my firearm’s missing. He must’ve grabbed it in the chaos!</DIALOGUE>
        <DIALOGUE>~y~You:~s~ Understood. I’ll track him down.</DIALOGUE>
